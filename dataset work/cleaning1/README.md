Week of 4/18/2022

This week will be a simple cleaning exercise, using dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandaramg/taxi-trip-data-nyc

I will focus on cleaning, standardizing, and trimming data to present data with as few unknowns and useless information as possible 
by dropping columns, cleaning NaN values, and standardizing data types and column titles.
