    <label>Dear Alex,</label>
    <main>
        <p>     This is a letter from me to you because I am practing working on my HTML code 
            and I do not know much about it at all but I figured I'd pull you into this 
            because why not </p>
        <p>This is the second paragraph. Apparently indentations don't mean anything to 
            VSC which, frankly, I find quite rude. Indentations are characters too!
        </p>
        <p> Thank you for unwittingly taking part in this simple, dumb exercise that
            I have forgotten to sleep through. But hey, at least the code makes me look
            like I know what I'm doing. 
        </p>
    </main>
    <label>Sincerely,</label>
    
    <p> Matthew Barger</p>
