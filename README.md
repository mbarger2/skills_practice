# Skills Practice

In my own time, beginning in the summer of 2022, I am choosing to work through different exercises of my own creation to continue to train my Data Analytic skills as I look for a position in the field. These exercises will primarily use python in Jupyter and vary between cleaning, modeling, creating/manipulating raw data, web scraping, etc. but occasionally will use MySQL, Excel VBA, and Tableau as well.
